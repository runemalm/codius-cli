# OpenDDD CLI

OpenDDD CLI is an interactive command-line assistant for designing and evolving domain models in C# using the [OpenDDD.NET](https://github.com/davidrunemalm/openddd.net) framework.

Built with LangGraph and powered by OpenAI, the assistant helps you:
- Explore and model aggregate roots, value objects, and entities
- Translate modeling decisions into tactical DDD patterns
- Generate well-structured code following OpenDDD conventions
- Iterate on the domain model through conversational refinement

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ Natural-language modeling (e.g. “Add product bundles to Order”)
- 🧠 Intent distillation and tactical DDD planning
- ⚙️ Code generation for aggregates, repositories, and other building blocks
- 🧪 Preview diffs before applying changes
- 💾 Session-based memory with domain grounding
- 🔌 LangGraph architecture with node-by-node clarity

## 🚧 Status

This is an early MVP and under active development. Contributions and feedback welcome!
