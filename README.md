# Codius

A coding assistant for domain-driven design projects in ASP.NET Core.

---


## ‚ú® Why Codius?

`Codius` is a tool under active development with one clear goal:

> Free domain-driven designers from boilerplate and let them focus on modeling.

Instead of writing out every aggregate, method, and repository by hand, you describe what you want to build ‚Äî and Codius helps generate the code that matches your intent, aligned with the [OpenDDD.NET](https://www.openddd.net) framework.

It doesn‚Äôt try to replace your thinking ‚Äî it amplifies it.  
You stay in control of the model. Codius handles the scaffolding and code generation.

If you‚Äôre passionate about DDD, code quality, and improving developer flow, try Codius ‚Äî or help shape it by contributing to its development.

## üöÄ Get Started

```bash
$ pip install codius  # Temporary package name
$ cd /my/project/root # Go to your project's root
$ codius              # Starts Codius CLI
```

On first run, Codius will create `.openddd/config.yaml` and initialize a modeling session.

## üó£ Example
