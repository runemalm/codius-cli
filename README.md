# Codius

A coding assistant for domain-driven design projects.

---

## ‚ú® Why Codius?

`Codius` is inspired by coding assistants like OpenAI‚Äôs Codex and Anthropic‚Äôs Claude.  
If you're familiar with those tools, the interface will feel instantly familiar.

If you're a domain-driven design practitioner ‚Äî or curious contributor ‚Äî try it out by following the instructions below.

Want to contribute? Reach out ‚Äî or just create a feature branch and submit a PR. I‚Äôll review and get back to you ASAP.

## üöÄ Get Started

```bash
$ pip install codius  # Temporary package name
$ cd /my/project/root # Go to your project's root
$ codius              # Starts Codius CLI
```

On first run, Codius will create `.openddd/config.yaml` and initialize a modeling session.

## üó£ Example

> _TODO: Insert a screenshot at `/images/screenshot.png` showing the CLI interface._

Sample prompt:

```bash
> Create an aggregate called Order with a method to calculate total price.
```

Codius will:

- Understand your intent
- Plan code changes
- Generate the code
- Ask for approval
- Apply the changes

## üß± What is OpenDDD.NET?

Codius is built for projects using [**OpenDDD.NET**](https://www.openddd.net) ‚Äî an open-source framework for building distributed, event-driven systems using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** in ASP.NET Core.

OpenDDD.NET helps you:

- Organize your code into bounded contexts and building blocks
- Work with aggregates, repositories, and events
- Build reliable, scalable applications using DDD best practices
